#Milestone 3.4
so far in this hangman project, we have been able to create a program which asks for a user input as a guessed letter and checks to see if that guessed letter is in a list of words. The program also checks and makes sure the user input is a single string value and will prompt the user to try again if it isn't. Once the Program completes it's purpose it will break, if it hasn't it keeps going until it recieves the correct input.
#Update 
Hangman project now underway with milestones 1-5 copleted. Methods that check the guess and input have been made. Program is currently able to ask for user input and check if the user input is a single alphanumerical character, as well as checking the users guessed word against the list of random words and prompting the user to either try again and lose a life or re-enter their if conditions aren't met(single character alphanumerical value). File sent to git hub repo.
Program breaks if num_lives becomes 0.



#Update Milestone_5.py added
New file, added code. New game function

#Usage Instructions
Start by running the program.

You'll see a prompt for When requiring input, enter a letter.

Play the game by guessing the letters untill you've landed on the correct letter and have guessed the whole word. If you guess wrong, you'll run out of lives and the game will finish.

Live tracker available to see what you've guessed correctly, check progress and see how many lives you have left.

The game ends when either condition is met.
